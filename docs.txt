Files:

README.md: has the report
funcs.py: has helper functions, and reads the pattern
    4 main functions:
        compare: compares if two strings are identical
        sub_compare: compares if two strings have an identical half
        forward_checking: checks in a forward manner if we have a rep, insr, or del
        backward_checking: uses forward_checking but flips the input
requirements.txt: has requirements
exact.py: finds the exact matches
offby1.py: find the matches up to one mismatch
info: has the info dump that comes from the output of exact.py, offby1.py and the time tool.
docs.txt: this file


How to run:
make sure funcs.py has the path to the file containing the patters
    To find exact matches, run exact.py but make sure filename has the path to the genome you want.
    To find up to one mismatch, run offby1.py but also make sure file name has the path to the genome.
